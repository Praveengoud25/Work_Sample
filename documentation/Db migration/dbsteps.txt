1. First Find the credinatials of old rds writer instance.

2. Next check from which instance we can login into that RDS.

3. In that instance create a new folder for the process: mkdir db_migration

4. cd db_migration

5. we need check the rows and columns of each table and take screen shots to re-check it after migration.

6. we need to run mysqldump cmds to pull each table dump to local.

7. upload them to s3 if rds's are in diffrent VPC or else we can upload from same instance into new RDS by checking connection test once.

8. if needed login into a other instance where we can connect to new RDS

9. download all the dumps uploaded to the s3 in step 3

10. next create Databases, Application owner will create it.

11. apply the dumps to the compaction database.

12. validate the number of rows and columns in new RDS the same which we done at step 1.
